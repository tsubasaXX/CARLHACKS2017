			<h2>Our History</h2>
			<p>Project Friendship has a rich history in the community that dates back to 1965. Over the past 50 years, it is estimated that over 4,000 local children have been matched with a mentor.
			ï»¿In 1965, a group of Northfield women came together with the idea of matching Northfield Elementary School students with St. Olaf and Carleton College students as a friend and role model. Merrell Thornton and Diane Enebeck agreed to serve as co-directors for two years in 1970. At that time, Project Friendship recruited 10-15 mothers who each managed 10 student/college student pairs. Matches were made based on gender and similar interests.
			In 1974, the board hired Sharon Day as the first paid director. Laurie Cowles followed and under her direction Project Friendship flourished servicing over 100 students each year over a 20 year period of time. Laurie turned over her responsibilities to Carolyn Svenson. In 1996, Kathy Lansing directed the program with help from consultant Joan Lizsola (assisting to help better serve our Hispanic community). In August of 2014, Sarah VanSickle was hired as the Executive Director.</p>

			<h2>Our Children</h2>
			<p>Project Friendship mentors are matched with children from the Northfield Elementary and Middle Schools. We also provide mentors to children that are home schooled in the Northfield area.
			School social workers help prioritize matches with children that have the hightest need based on their situation. Of the 76 children matched in 2013-2014, 14% were Latino and 50% were from a single parent home and/or low-income families. 90% of parents surveyed said mentoring made a difference in their child's life, school performance, and attitude.</p>

			<h2>Our Student Mentor</h2>
			<p>Volunteer mentors from St. Olaf and Carleton Colleges are matched with same gender children with similar interests each September. Many of the mentors are two page scholars, from diverse backgrounds and places. In 2013, several international students were matched with 3 foreign adopted children. The average match lasts 2.5 years!
			The screening process includes a background check and several inperson interviews with the Executive Director. The mentor is required to attend an orientation and training session in October each year. Additional training sessions are offered throughout the year. Program Coordinators and the Executive Director communicate regularly with the mentors to ensure they have the resources and support they need.</p>
