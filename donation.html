		<h1>HOW YOU CAN HELP</h1>
		<p>Project Friendship can use your support both financially and by spreading the word about this program. Word of mouth and social media outlets are great ways to help other be aware of our program. You never know who you may help by sharing one of our facebook posts!
		Sustaining the work in our community has been made possible by the financial contributions and time of many individuals and organizations. While grants and various fundraisers help support our budget, we need your help filling in the rest.	 
		Your donation will help train our volunteers, provide weekly mentoring throughout the academic year, and give hope and inspiration to young people who need someone they can look up to. We estimate that a donation of $250 covers the cost to serve one young person for the academic year.</p>
		<p>We are excited to announce that Project Friendship is a proud partner of Thrivent's Choice DollarsÂ® program. Eligible Thrivent members can recommend which nonprofit organizations they feel should receive charitable grant funding from Thrivent Financial. 
		If you have Choice Dollars available to direct, please consider directing them to Project Friendship at www.thrivent.com/thriventchoice 
		We plan to use Thrivent Choice funding to support our mission to empower youth in Northfield through caring adult mentoring relationships.</p>
		<p>We are so grateful for any donation amount! All contributions are tax deductible.</p>
