				<h1>Parent's role at Project Friendship</h1>
				<h2><b>
					The friendship that is developed between a mentor and mentee is a special relationship just for them, but you have an important role in helping that relationship be successful.
				</b>
				</h2>
				<p>
				Think about how you are involved in other activities (i.e. sports, music, theater, etc) your child participates in. You listen about how it is going, make sure sthey attend all scheduled activities, and communicate with an adult in the organization/club/team. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Your role in the mentoring program will be similar. Here are some specific ways that you can help make your child’s mentoring experience successful:
				</p>
				<h2><b>With your child</b></h2>
				<p>
				<li>. Encourage your child to keep all meetings with the mentor, and have your child contact the mentor or program staff if he can’t make an appointment.</li></p>
				</p><li>.  Be positive about the relationship, and let your child see you are happy that he has a mentor in her life.</li></p>
				</p>. <li>.  Remind your child to thank her mentor and show appreciation for the time they spend together.</li> </p>
				<p><li>. Ask open‐ended questions about how things are going. For example, “What was the best thing you did with your mentor today?” can yield more results than “Did you have a good time with your mentor today?” </li></p>
				<p><li>.  Listen to your child and be supportive of her feelings. Be patient and encouraging.</li></p>
				<p><li>.  Tell your child when you notice positive changes as a result of having a mentor. Your praise means a lot!</li></p>
				<b><h2> With the mentor </h2></b>
				<b><li>. Remember that the mentor is there for your child, not for you or other children in your family. Don’t ask the mentor to take other siblings along on outings or to become your friend or counselor</li></b>
				
				<p><li>. Assist your child in communicating with their big buddy to set up a weekly time to meet.</li></p>
				<p><li>. Provide transportation to and from the college at the scheduled times  </li></p>
				<p><li>. Notify the mentor if your child is unable to attend their meeting time  </li></p>
				<p><li>. This is a special time for your child to have a friend all to themselves. Please do not have additional children (friends or siblings) at these meetings.  </li></p>
				<p><li>. Notify Executive Director of any concerns, questions or if your child is not meeting on a regular basis or if your child no longer wishes to continue with their mentor.  </li></p>
				<p><li>. Notify mentor and Executive Director if any contact information changes. Be sure it's always current!  </li></p>
				<p><li>. Be accountable and stay in touch, it's important to your child.  </li></p>
